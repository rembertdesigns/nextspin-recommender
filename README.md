# 🎧 Next Spin – Your AI Crate-Digging Companion

Next Spin is an AI-powered vinyl recommender built *for collectors, by collectors*. Whether you're building your taste, chasing rare pressings, or stacking high-ROI flips — this tool helps you discover what to spin (or snag) next.

## 💡 What It Does
Next Spin analyzes your collection to recommend:
- 🔍 **Taste-aligned gems** – Deep cuts and rare finds based on your genres, moods, and favorite labels
- 🧩 **Missing links** – Albums that bridge the gap between your favorites
- 💰 **Smart buys** – Records likely to rise in value, so you know when to buy or wait
- 🎒 **Crate bundles** – Curated 5-record suggestions with cost + rarity insights

## 🧠 How It Works
